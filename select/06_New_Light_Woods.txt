With all this lake that surrounds me
Dreams of colour will be by your side
May we all sleep tonight
Those thoughts of you still escapes me
Burning right like we seek in summer
May we all sleep tonight
Your only hope for tomorrow is start a new
Whats burning inside some part of you
With all this lake that surrounds me
Dreams of colour will be by your side
May we all sleep tonight
Those thoughts of you still escape me
Burning right like we seek in summer
May we all sleep tonight
Your only hope for tommorow is start a new
What burns inside some parts of you
Your only hope for tommorow is start a new
What burns inside some parts of you
