I'm the boy in your other phone
Lightin' up inside your drawer at home
All alone
Pushin' forty in the friendzone
We talk and then you walk away
Every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I want a take two
I wanna breakthrough
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you
Look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say anyway?
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, baby

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I want a take two, I wanna breakthrough
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Oh, I want a take two, I wanna breakthrough
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
